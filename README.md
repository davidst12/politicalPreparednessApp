## Project Instructions

Same instructions as explained in 'Design and Build an Android Application' in the kotlin course.

In this project, students will build an application that provides civic data intended to provide educational opportunities to the U.S. electorate using data provided by the Google Civic Information API. Students will use data from this API to allow users to track information on target representatives and voting initiatives where applicable.

Users will be able to target a specific location and retrieve the associated civic data, displaying it to the user, and providing a clean user experience for consumption. Users will be able to save predefined locations for quick access and mark preferred representatives and policy outcomes. Where available, elections and voter information will also be provided, notifying the users on upcoming elections and providing access to associated information and saved data.
